=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::FakeRelease - fake plugin to test release

=head1 VERSION

version 5.006

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    [FakeRelease]
    user = CPANAUTHORID ; # optional.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is a L<Releaser|Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser> that does nothing. It
is directed to plugin authors, who may need a dumb release plugin to test their
shiny plugin implementing L<BeforeRelease|Dist::Zilla::Role::BeforeRelease>
and L<AfterRelease|Dist::Zilla::Role::AfterRelease>.

When this plugin does the release, it will just log a message and finish.

If you set the environment variable C<DZIL_FAKERELEASE_FAIL> to a true value,
the plugin will die instead of doing nothing. This can be useful for
authors wanting to test reliably that release failed.

You can optionally provide the 'user' parameter, which defaults to 'AUTHORID',
which will allow things that depend on this metadata
( Sometimes provided by L<UploadToCPAN|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN> ) to still work.
( For example: L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Twitter> )
