=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir::Template - gather all the files in a directory and use them as templates

=head1 VERSION

version 5.006

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of the L<GatherDir|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir>
plugin.  It works just like its parent class, except that each
gathered file is processed through L<Text::Template>.

The variables C<$plugin> and C<$dist> will be provided to the
template, set to the GatherDir::Template plugin and the Dist::Zilla
object, respectively.

It is meant to be used when minting dists with C<dzil new>, but could be used
in building existing dists, too.
