=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Role::NameProvider - something that provides a name for the dist

=head1 VERSION

version 5.006

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plugins implementing this role must provide a C<provide_name> method that
will be called when setting the dist's name.

If a NameProvider offers a name but one has already been set, an
exception will be raised.  If C<provide_name> returns undef, it will be
ignored.
